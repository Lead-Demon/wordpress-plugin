# Lead Demon Tracking WordPress Plugin
Lead Demon is a [cold email software](https://www.leaddemon.io) which you can use to send cold emails with automated follow-ups from your email account. Lead Demon tracks clicks and conversions using a JavaScript code which needs to be inserted into your website.

We have created a WordPress plugin which makes this easier to integrate on your website, and we supply the source code so that it can be further modified if needed. You can download the plugin in ZIP format by [clicking here](https://www.leaddemon.io/plugin/lead-demon.zip) or install it directly in WordPress by using the following URL:
`https://www.leaddemon.io/plugin/lead-demon.zip`

The plugin will simply add the clicking tracking code to every page on your website, unless it finds a **conversion=1** in the URL. In that case it will load the conversion tracking JavaScript.

When a customer converts, i.e signs up on your website, purchases something, simply redirect them to the thank you page and append conversion=1 in the URL

For example:

- *https://www.yourwebsite.com/thank-you.html?conversion=1*
- *https://www.yourwebsite.com/thank-you.html?orderId=10000&conversion=1*
